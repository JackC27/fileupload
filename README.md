# fileupload
### Bare bones file upload with react

-This software does not modify file names.  
-You will need to add the extension to the file name  
-all it does is get a file to a folder. 

#### To Begin:  
-Open terminal  
-`cd` to the directory this software is in  
-`npm start`  
-point your browser to localhost:3000  

-Option one:  
  Uses an html form element and all of its glory  
  
-Option two:  
  Uses JS and `new FormData()`
